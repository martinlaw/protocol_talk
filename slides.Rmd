# Why publish protocol?

# Lessons

Templates can be very different

Consider updating your CTU's own templates to match a journal's (probably that of *Trials*)

"Converting" a protocol is harder the more developed the protocol is... so start early

# Authorship

Who should the authors be?

# Related: The SAP

Publish this too. 

Is it counted as a publication in its own right? Always? Or only when published fully separately from the protocol? (See Sarah Dawson's scholar page)

Who should be the authors of the SAP?
